# Data-Engineering-Project---2

**Objective:**
The project aims to design and implement a robust data pipeline for processing customer account data. This includes copying data from ADLS GEN2 (Bronze layer) and transforming the data in the Silver layer using Data bricks Notebooks and storing the data into Gold layer using SCDType 1 Delta Table in ADLS GEN2. The pipeline aims to ensure efficient, accurate, and scalable data processing to support downstream analytics and reporting needs.

**Dataset used:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/varunkumari/ai-bank-dataset

**Tools required:**
•	Azure Data Lake Gen 2 Storage
•	Azure Databricks
•	App registration – service principal
•	Azure Keyvault
•	Pyspark
•	Power BI Desktop
•	Microsoft Fabric
•	Draw.io – for architecture diagram

A pdf named **"Financial Data Analysis"** that explains how this project was built has been uploaded to this repository.

**Test files** which were used as "day2 files" (files with new data) are also uploaded in this repository.
